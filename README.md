# Advanced-Warning-System-DBM
This system is for 1 server bots only! The warning transfer over different servers!
In each ``Create Embed Message`` the color will have to be changed.
``warn`` warns a user
``warnings`` displays the warnings of the user
``clr-warns`` clears all the warnings on the member's record
``rm-warn`` removes the specified warning ([p]rm-warn [@user] [number of warning in the list])
The ``warn`` command logs to a channel so you will need to change that.
